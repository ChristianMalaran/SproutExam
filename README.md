If we are going to deploy this on production:

We should consider the ff:

1.Security Enhancements 
    - Implement security best practices, such as input validation, to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - 2FA for log in
    - Create 0auth or jwt for token authorization request

2. Optimize database queries and use caching to reduce load times.

3. Scalability
    - Evaluate cloud-based solutions such as Azure

4. User Experience (UX) Improvements
    - Enhance the application's user interface (UI) and ensure it's responsive and mobile-friendly
    - Gather user feedback and conduct usability testing to identify areas where the user experience can be improved.

5.  Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process, ensuring that code changes are tested and deployed reliably.

6. Data Backup and Disaster Recovery
    - Implement regular data backups and a disaster recovery plan to ensure data integrity and availability in case of unexpected events.

7.Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
    - Maintain comprehensive documentation for developers and end-users to facilitate onboarding and troubleshooting
